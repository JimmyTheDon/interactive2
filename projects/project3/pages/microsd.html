        <p><strong>The Micro Secure Digital Card</strong><br><br>
          Date of Creation: November 2013<br>
          Date of Obsolescence: December 2024<br>
          Company: Kingston Technology<br><br>
          This was a Micro Secure Digital Card, essentially a smaller version of the standard Secure Digital Card. The term "Secure Digital" was normally abbreviated to "SD" to shorten the term for easier usage. During the time of its creation, it was primarily used to expand the storage of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets. These Micro SDs were also always sold with an extended addon that transformed them into standard sized SD Cards expanding their uses to recording devices such as cameras and various physical media players.
