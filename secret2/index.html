    	<p>
    		<span class="question">How do I control what information is gathered?</span><br>
    		<span class="answer">You can't really control that ascpect too much. It more or less fall upon what kind of information you put out on the internet. Anything that can be seen, is essential information that is public. You can also always opt-out, and that could be as simple as ticking the button in your browser setting to opt-out, or it sould be contacting the service.</span><br><br><span class="question">I hear a lot about this data mining, but it is still unclear to me.</span><br>
    		<span class="answer">It is essentially logging whatever you do on a site, it can be as obvious as your input into textfields and search bars, to things as discrete as tracking your mouse movements; how long you hover over a certain area, what you hover on, and what you click. It could also even be as creepy as picking up on key terms using your microphone.</span><br><br>
    		<span class="question">I know I am being data mined by the services I use and I am okay with that.</span><br>
    		<span class="answer">Yeah data mining is something unpreventable nowadays, even if we try to opt-out it is up to them to acknowledge our option to opt-out. However privacy and security goes hand-in-hand, and we should still be cautious of the services we use and what we link to our social media accounts because these third party services may not have as secure of a storage service as larger services, or their storage services are outside of the United States. On top of that, every service collects a variety of different information, so it is also important to pay attention to the type of information they collect and if that is what you want them collecting.</span><br><br>
    		<span class="question">What difference does it make if their storage services are here in the United States or elsewhere? </span><br>
    		<span class="answer">Not every country agrees on the same privacy and anonymity policies and standards, resulting in different standards in terms of security. In the U.S. our connections from point A to B is the most encrypted. Outside of the U.S. that may not be the same.</span><br><br>
    		<span class="question">Then what of the TOR network? Isn't it suppose to make connections more private, anonymous, and secure?</span><br>
    		<span class="answer">Yes and no. On the TOR network, your point A to B connection becomes a point A to whatever depending on how many nodes are used between you and the destination. You pretty much get bounced around from node to node to mask your original connection point, but your connection is probably only secured during the initial connection from you to a local node. Every connection afterwards is vulnerable to anyone to intercept, and is extremely vulnerable at the end connection from the last node to your destination. The TOR network is a great tool, but use with caution; do not send any emails or messages over it, better yet, do not log into any accounts over it.</span><br><br>
    		<span class="question">Well, why even bother then? It seems like all of this is impossible to avoid.</span><br>
    		<span class="answer">Well yeah, it all comes down to making smarter decisions online, reading the policies, and understanding what is being done with your data. Paying attention to what information you provide and information that is asked of you. Don't post or do anything you wouldn't in real life. If you really need to be anonymous or untracable to an extent, use a public computer, a trusted virtual private network (VPN), or the TOR network, but don't do anyhting on it that will link back to you.</span><br><br>
    		<span class="question">Conclusion?</span><br>
    		<span class="answer">There are so many discrepencies between what people say and do these days. They post these long statuses on Facebook critizing the privacy policy yet the continue mindlessly sharing things without a second thought the next day. Some are against the data mining done by the social media services, yet they use other services that data mine similarly such as loyalty reward programs, the various apps they have on their smartphone, and even the smartphones themselves. So this is why this site was created, to hopefully bring a better understanding to all of this.</span><br><br>
